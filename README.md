This code is used to interface and read data from Benewake single point LiDARs using Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. 
The following assumptions are made while developing this code:
1.	The end-user has Pico microcontroller and any of the single point LiDARs (Luna, TFmini-Plus, mini-S, TF02-pro, TF03-UART) in hands
2.	The development environment (including Pico SDK) for compiling the C code has already been set
3.	All the necessary cables and 5V power supply
4.	The LiDAR interface mode is TTL
5.	Any editor for writing and modifying the script (VS Code is recommended)
